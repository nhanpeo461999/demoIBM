You will deploy an ASP.NET Core web app by using the GitHub  [asp-net-core-web-app](https://github.com/gayanvoice/asp-net-core-web-app)  to IBM Cloud Foundry by using continuous integration with GitHub.

The advantage of selecting IBM Cloud for application deployment over AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure is the  **process is simple**, and  **you don’t need to add a credit card to activate the account**.

I created an IBM cloud account, and  **if you don’t have an IBM Cloud account you can go to this tutorial**.

# 1 — Add manifest.yml to solution directory

-   Add a  **_manifest.yml_**  to your solution directory as like this this file  [**manifest.yml**](https://github.com/gayanvoice/asp-net-core-web-app/blob/master/manifest.yml)  and push changes to the GitHub repository.
-   If you are using Lite account the  **maximum memory limit is 256M**. You can use low memory, in this case I use 64M.
-   Push your changes to the repository.
-   You don’t need to add  **manifest.yml**, if you are using the repository  [**https://github.com/gayanvoice/asp-net-core-web-app**](https://github.com/gayanvoice/asp-net-core-web-app).

# 2 — Build your own toolchain

1.  Go to  [**cloud.ibm.com/catalog**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog)  and enter “Toolchain”.
2.  Select  **Toolchain** card.
3.  Scroll down to find  **Other Templates**  category and select  **Build your own toolchain**  card.
4.  Give a  **Toolchain Name**  and  **Select Region**. In this case Toolchain Name is  _asp-net-core-web-app-toolchain_  and Select Region is  _Dallas._ Refer Figure 1 — Build your own toolchain.
5.  Click  **Create** button to continue.

# 3 — Create Continuous Delivery Service

1.  Go to  [**cloud.ibm.com/catalog**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog)  and enter “Continuous Delivery”.
2.  Select  **Continuous Delivery**  card.
3.  **Select Region**,  **Select a pricing plan,**  and scroll down to find  **Configure your resource**  category. Give  **Service Name.** In this case Select Region is  _dallas,_ Select a pricing place is  _Lite,_  and Service Name is  _asp-net-core-web-app-continuous-delivery._ The Refer Figure 2— Create Continuous Delivery Service.
4.  Click  **Create**  button to continue.

# 4— Add Tool integrations

We have to add GitHub, Eclipse Orion Web IDE, and Delivery Pipeline to the toolchain. You can follow the official doc  [create a custom toolchain task 2](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/tutorials/create-a-custom-toolchain?task=2)  by IBM. You can find  _asp-net-core-web-app-toolchain_  under  **Developer tools**  in  [**Resources list**](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources).
